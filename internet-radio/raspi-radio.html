A few years ago I hacked an Asus Router to become an 
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/166/ziemann.html">internet radio</A> by putting
OpenWRT on it and adding a USB sound card. At that time this setup was the only 
way I could figure out to make an intelligent box that hooks up to the Internet
at one end and spit out music at the other. The system, located in our kitchen 
is still in use, but when we got a new stereo in the living room, it was time to 
revisit the Internet radio situation. 
<P>
Of course, today we have the Raspberry Pi available, which has all the necessary 
hardware on board, namely an Ethernet port, either wired or wireless, and an
analog sound output. Having decided on the hardware a little research on the
web about other people's solutions to the same problem resulted in the following
strategy for the software.
<UL>
  <LI> Use the music player daemon <TT>mpd</TT> for sound
  <LI> Control it via the associated controller software <TT>mpc</TT>
  <LI> Use <TT>apache2</TT> to serve a web interface with forms and cgi-bin 
       functionality to select radio channels from the playlist
  <LI> Display what is currently playing
  <LI> The ability to shut down the raspi gracefully via the web interface, which 
       proved a bit tricky, but more on that below.
</UL>
There is no hardware work involved in this approach, only some programming, but in
the end I had a system that I can control from any computer with web access to the
raspi, including cell phones or tablets. If you like the hardware solutions, just
browse the web. There are some <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4n2OtwGl0">
really cool projects</A> out there.
<P>
For the software approach I use the standard current Debian Wheezy distribution and 
assume that you have your raspi connected to the Internet, either by cable or WLAN.
Wired ethernet normally works out of the box if you have a DHCP server on your network,
most routers do that by default. If you use WLAN probaly the easiest way is to start 
the X-window interface by executing <TT>startx</TT> on the command line and run the 
WIFI setup that you can find on the desktop. Once your hooked up to your network you 
need to find out the IP number of the raspi. Just run
<PRE>
        ifconfig
</PRE> 
which will display the settings for each network adapter. Find a line that starts
with <TT> inet addr:</TT> and the four numbers following that look like 192.168.1.102
is the IP number of the raspi. You will need that later when controlling the radio
from your cell phone. Your actual IP number will likely be different from the one shown 
above. If you are connected by wire and WLAN, you will have two interfaces eth0 and 
wlan0. The IP number of either network interface will work for the internet radio.
<P>
OK, now we proceed by installing the required packages by opening a terminal window
and typing
<PRE>
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install mpd mpc apache2
</PRE>
Having the required software installed it is time to test the basic functionality.
The <TT>mpd</TT> program is a daemon, that runs in the background and is started
automatically at boot time. We interact with the daemon by the <TT>mpc</TT> program.
For good measure I suggest to reboot the system, even though that's not strictly
necessary. When the system is turned off it is a good time to connect the raspi to
some active loudspeakers with built in amplifier. Or, if you dare, connect it to 
some input of your stereo amplifier. For this you might need a cable that has a
3.5 mm connector that is attached to the raspi and RCA connectors that are attached
to the amplifier.
<P>
In order to play the radio stations we need to inform the raspi about the channels.
For this I prepared a small text file that contains the Internet addresses of the radio 
stations I want to listen to, one station per line with URL and port number, separated
by a colon. A simple sample file looks like this
<PRE>
        http://108.61.73.118:8030
        http://109.123.116.202:8022
</PRE>
and call that file <TT>pls.txt</TT>. The actual name does not matter, just pick any
one you prefer. We can now tell <TT>mpd</TT> about our playlist by typing
<PRE>
        cat pls.txt | mpc add
</PRE>
and check that it swallowed it by
<PRE>
        mpc playlist
</PRE>
which should return contents of the file, the list of stations by their URL. Now it is
time to start making noise, which is done by the command
<PRE>
        mpc play 1
</PRE> 
to play the
first station in the playlist and <TT>mpc play 2</TT> to play the second. If your list is 
longer by having more lines with channels in the <TT>pls.txt</TT> file, I am sure you'll 
figure out how to address them. Normally the play command connects to the radio station rather
quickly in less than a second or two and should result in some music. The two channels above
have been stable for a long time and are a classic rock station, playing Led Zeppelin and
Queen, and the second station playing classical classical music, like Beethoven and Mozart.
The command
<PRE>
       mpc stop
</PRE> 
stops playing the music and
<PRE>
       mpc current
</PRE>
tells you, what is currently playing. These are just the basic functions, for more just
check the manual page for <TT>mpc.</TT> 
<P>
As a matter of fact you can find a long list of Internet radio stations at the following
URLs
<PRE>
       http://www.listenlive.eu
       http://www.internet-radio.com
       http://www.radio-locator.com
</PRE>
Check it out and add your favorites to the playlist file <TT>pls.txt</TT>.
<P>
At this point you can take a shortcut and install for example the app <TT>mpdroid</TT> 
on your smart-phone and remotely control the <TT>mpd</TT> daemon on your raspi. You'd get
some functionality, but miss out on the fun of learning a bit of HTML and CGI-BIN
controls of your raspi. 
<P>
<H3>HTML</H3>
<P>
At this point the basic audio functionality is established and we need to add the
control interface, which is provided by the <TT>apache2</TT> server. I assume that
you know the IP number of your raspi, that you have determined before. On any
computer, on your local net, including the raspi itself, fire up a browser and
add the IP of your raspi to the address line. You should receive a message that says
<PRE>
          It works!
          This is the default web ....
</PRE>
which means that your apache2 web server is running, which it should do automatically
after installing it, which is what you should have done, if you followed the instructions.
<P>
The web server basically dishes out web pages which are located on the raspi. The page
you were just shown is actually a file named <TT>index.html</TT> that resides in the
directory <TT>/var/www/</TT> by default. You can change that location by fiddling with
the apache2 configuration files, but I assume you use, as I do, the default configuration
that came with the installation.
<BR>
<BR>    
What we have to do is to replace the index.html file with another one that provides 
the Internet radio interface. Here is a screen-shot of what I ended up with
<P>
<IMG SRC="screenshot1.png" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="850" ALT="Screenshot">
<P>
On the left hand side there is a red area with several useful links like the different
Internet radios scattered in my household, links to the Swedish TV program, links to 
sites with Internet radio stations, and some more useful things. On the right hand side 
in the upper half of the screen there is the radio interface with buttons for playing
and stopping and below that there are twelve buttons for the radio stations in the
playlist file pls.txt, mine has twelve entries, obviously. The three buttons in the
bottom row are kind of self-explanatory. Finally, below the buttons is a status area,
where the information from the button presses is displayed. In the above example I
pressed the "Available Stations" button and the twelve links are displayed. Above that
the hostname of the raspi "Wohnzimmer" and its IP number is displayed. I found that
useful for debugging.
<P>
Having described the interface, we now turn to the implementation. To set up the main
window divided up into three parts, the left red sidebar, the button interface and 
the status display, I use html framesets. The index.html file that replaces the
default one in <TT>/var/www</TT> looks like this
<P>
<IMG SRC="index_html.png" ALIGN="CENTER">
<P>
where the head contains just the title information.
Then there are two nested framesets, the first contains a frame with a file named
<TT>indexlist.html</TT> which contains the stuff in the red sidebar. and the second 
frameset with two frames, one for the radio interface, <TT>radio.html</TT> and one for 
the status page, <TT>status.html</TT>. The frameset instructions contain specifications
of the subdivision of the page. The first subdivides the page into two parts, where the 
red sidebar will be 170 pixels wide and the rest is given to the second frameset. The
second frameset instruction vertically (rows=) splits its allocated space evenly between the
two frames with the radio and the status. Note that the frames have names, which
we will later need to direct output to the proper places.
<P>
The file <TT>indexlist.html</TT> that describes the stuff in the red sidebar on the
left is shown here
<P>
<IMG SRC="indexlist.png" ALIGN="CENTER">
<P>
We see the usual header and body directives, here actually the red background is defined.
Then there is just a list of html anchors with the links to the respective web pages.
Note, however that the anchors have a target directive, which directs the called web
page either to a  new window with <TT>target=blank</TT> or to a named frame, here with
<TT>target=main</TT> to the radio area. This feature we will later use to direct output
to the status section of the page.
<P>
The status page is rather trivial. It just contains the opening and closing html and body 
directives and some dummy text. This will be overwritten dynamically later.
<P>
<H3>CGI-BIN</H3>
<P>
The file <TT>radio.html</TT> contains all the fun interactive stuff. Here the interaction with the
raspi actually takes place. After the normal HTML, HEAD and BODY stuff and a header the
interface is built as a horizontal table sandwiched between TR and /TR tags. Each entry 
in the table is declared between the TD and /TD tags. Inbetween these tags a FORM is
defined that executes and action on the raspi as defined by the instruction
<TT>action="cgi-bin/play.sh"</TT>, uses the POST method and directs the output of
whatever the <TT>play.sh</TT> script produces to the status window. The trigger to 
execute the form we define a button through the INPUT tag which displays "Play"
and submits the request to execute the <TT>play.sh</TT> script on the server.
See the excerpt from the <TT>radio.html</TT> file below.
<P>
<IMG SRC="radio.png" ALIGN="CENTER">
<P>
The stanza with between the TR tags is repeated four times to produce four rows of 
buttons and inbetween there are four blocks with the TD tags and the enclosed form.
Observe, that I supply an argument to the <TT>play.sh</TT> script by appending
a question mark and a number. 
<P>
You may wonder what these scripts are and where they reside on the raspi. When the
<TT>apache2</TT> server is installed, a directory <TT>/usr/lib/cgi-bin</TT> is automatically
created and you just put the the scripts in there. Note that you need sudo permission to 
put files there.
<P>
Let's start with the <TT>stop.sh</TT> script, because it is one of the simplest. Here
is the contents of the file <TT>/usr/lib/cgi-bin/stop.sh</TT>
<PRE>
    #!/bin/bash

    echo 'Content-type: text/plain'
    echo
    echo

    /usr/bin/mpc stop 
    echo "Radio stopped..."
</PRE>
Here the first line with <TT>#!/bin/bash</TT> tells the operating system that the
contents of this file should be treated as a sequence of <TT>bash</TT> commands,
where <TT>bash</TT> is a common shell, or command interpreter, of unixoids. 
The empty lines in the file are just for structuring and to 'guide the eye.'
Then, the three lines with <TT>echo</TT> print the 'Content-type' stuff and two
empty lines to standard output. The setup with the forms in the html cause
the output to be piped to the status section of our web page and the html
interpreter of the browser that receives that information is instructed by the
lines that there is just plain text following and therefore the browser as an
idea of how to format it. The line with <TT>/usr/bin/mpc stop</TT> executes
the <TT>mpc stop</TT> command on the raspi and whatever output it generates ends
up in the status window. For good measure the last echo command writes 'Radio
stopped...' to the status window. Just to  be sure.
<P>
Finally we need to make the file executable
<PRE>
        sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/stop.sh
</PRE>
which suitably changes file permissions by adding the execute bit with 'chmod +x'.
<P>
Just to summarize how the html on the raspi's web page, with forms and 
cgi-bin, cooperate, here's the short version: By pressing the 
'Stop' button on the web page the browser instructs the raspi to execute the
script <TT>stop.sh</TT> and pipe the output to the status window. The idea
is quite straightforward, though some of the syntax needs a bit of getting
used to.
<P>
The script files for 'Next', 'Previous' and the buttons in the bottom row all
work in the same fashion. First there's the <TT>#!/bin/bash</TT> line followed by
the 'Content' stuff with the three echos. Then there are just whatever commands
are suitably executed with their output piped to the status window. The only
exception is the play command, because I intend to send arguments from the
browser to it. You can see from the example above that I pass the station number
from the playlist in the FORM construct with <TT>action="cgi-bin/play.sh?1</TT>
after the question mark. So, how do we recover the string '1' when executing
the file <TT>play.sh</TT>? The form construct with cgi-bin actually makes the
stuff that follows the question mark available within the executing script in 
the environment variable <TT>${QUERY_STRING}.</TT> Check out my <TT>play.sh</TT>
file here
<PRE>
    #!/bin/bash
    echo 'Content-type: text/plain'
    echo
    echo
    if [ -z ${QUERY_STRING} ]; then
       /usr/bin/mpc play 
    else
       /usr/bin/mpc play "${QUERY_STRING}"
    fi
</PRE>
It contains the normal <TT>#!/bin/bash</TT> and echo things and then it test
for the existence of the <TT>$QUERY_STRING</TT> with the line 
<TT>if [ -z ${QUERY_STRING} ]; then</TT> and, depending whether it exists or not 
executes the <TT>mpc play</TT> command with or without the argument. Don't ask me, 
why it is called <TT>$QUERY_STRING</TT>! I am as puzzled as you are.
<P>
A warning!
Please note that I do not check the QUERY_STRING for illegal characters. A malicious
user could badly hack you system in this way. I use my raspi behind a router on a 
subnet only accessible by friendly users. Do not, again, absolutely do not put the
system on an unprotected network. That being said I had some basic protection in the 
old router based system, check <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/166/ziemann.html">there</A>
for the decode code.
<P>
<H3>Killerqueen</H3>
<P>
So far we have the basic functionality to control the <TT>mpd</TT> daemon via the
<TT>mpc</TT> program available via the web interface. It remains to turn the raspi
off using the web interface and that proved to be a bit tricky. Just pulling the 
power cable also works, albeit at the risk of corrupting the file system and it's
not really graceful, isn't it? So I wanted a button on the web interface to shut
the raspi down. My initial attempts directly call the shutdown command via cgi-bin 
did not work and I resorted to a trick. From the web interface I just create an
empty file in the <TT>/tmp</TT> directory called <TT>killerqueen</TT> (remember that
Queen song?). In the background I need another program the runs with the highest
permissions and that periodically checks the existence of the <TT>/tmp/killerqueen</TT> 
file and calls shutdown if it exists. 
<P>
Here is the <TT>shutdown.sh</TT> script that creates the <TT>/tmp/killerqueen</TT> 
file if the button on the web interface is pressed
<PRE>
    #!/bin/bash
    echo 'Content-type: text/plain'
    echo
    echo
    touch /tmp/killerqueen
    echo 'Shutting down... and creating /tmp/killerqueen'
</PRE>
and the file that periodically checks its existence every two seconds is called
<TT>killerqueen.sh</TT> which I placed in the <TT>/usr/local/bin</TT> directory.
It contains the following lines
<PRE>
    #!/bin/bash
    rm -f /tmp/killerqueen
    while [ True ]; do
        if [ -e /tmp/killerqueen ]; then
            echo 'file exists, removing'
            rm -f /tmp/killerqueen
            /sbin/shutdown -h now
        fi
        sleep 2
    done
</PRE>
After initially removing a forgotten /tmp/killerqueen file it enters an infinite loop
and checks the existence of the file. If it exists it removes the file and calls 
shutdown. Then the raspi comes to a halt and after a few seconds you can turn the power
off safely.
<P>
What remains is to start the <TT>killerqueen.sh</TT> script auto-magically and that is
most easily done by placing the line 
<PRE>
        /usr/local/bin/killerqueen.sh &
</PRE>
in the file <TT>/etc/init.d/rc.local</TT> which is executed at boot time automatically
and starts the killer queen to watch over the raspi. Note again, that anyone with access to
the web page of your raspi can turn it off. Make sure it is behind a router.
<P>
We've come quite a way in the process of turning the raspi into an Internet radio. On the way
we covered the <TT>mpd/mpc</TT> combo and setting up a web server together with creating
simple forms with framesets and interacting with the raspi via cgi-bin scripts. Please be
aware that this is absolutely not the only way to achieve the functionality, but for me it
was fun and instructive. 
<P>
By the way, you can download a tar ball with all the files 
<A HREF="raspiradio.tar.gz">here.</A> 
<P>
Finally a disclaimer. Please note that I describe everything to the best of my knowledge, but 
I cannot guarantee that it also works for you. Be careful and if you accidentally fry your cat 
by following my description, it is your (and your cats) problem.
