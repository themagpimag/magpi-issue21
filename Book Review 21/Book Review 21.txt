Scratch in Easy Steps - Sean McManus

I've just had a book published about Scratch, which covers the version used on the Raspberry Pi. I was wondering whether you might be interested in reviewing it in Magpi please? I've attached an information sheet about it here. I've already asked the publisher for a discount code for you and they said they can arrange a 30% discount for orders through their site.

Need to ask publisher for discount code....
