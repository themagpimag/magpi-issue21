Hi Aaron

Happy new year! 

To accompany the review of Scratch Programming in Easy Steps, I can confirm that the publisher has:
set up the discount code MAGPI20, giving 30% discount off all In Easy Steps titles (including ebooks) purchased from our online shop (www.ineasysteps.com) between 1-28 February 2014.

The discount code is valid wherever the publisher ships, but postage is payable at cost on print copies. I also wrote Web Design in Easy Steps, which will also be discounted under the promotion.

Let me know if you need anything else for this!

Best wishes
Sean
