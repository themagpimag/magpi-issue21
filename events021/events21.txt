DigiMakers; is a series of community technology events aimed at children (7-17), parents and teachers. This is an introduction to 'making' in the digital word, to inspire the next generation of technical innovators and engineers.   From programming software to hacking hardware, we want to show you more ways to have fun with technology.
 
 The British Institute for Computing (BCS), the University of Bristol and our hosts the science learning centre @Bristol are working together to bring you a day filled with hands-on workshops. There will also be a Raspberry Pi drop-in centre and a space where our experts can show-and-tell you about their projects.

For KS2 Children 8-11 years old
Codebreakers!
Codes are great fun. We will explore the basics of counting in binary to count up to 31 just using zeroes and ones. We will use our new counting skills to send simple messages to each other. Then we will encode the messages and try to break the codes. Ideally you will have attended our introductory Raspberry Pi day or had some experience of one at home or school.
