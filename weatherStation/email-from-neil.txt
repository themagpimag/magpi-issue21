Thanks also for your kind words about my dad. Sadly, he died some years ago but it is nice t know that his involvement at Arnhem is still  appreciated.

I attach three

The pdf files are looking good although there were a few issues, mostly around sub-headings. I also include some examples of source code which really need to be indented and perhaps in a different size or typeface to make them readable.

My detailed comments are listed below.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

1) Page 1 top of para 2.  I had included a sub-heading so it should read:-
  
Recording and Predicting the Weather
Accurate weather......


2) Page 1 para 2. Not sure that UK Met Office needs to be in bold.


3) Page 1 end para 2.. "network of ground-based weather stations include Synoptic recording the weather"  should read  "network of ground-based  stations include Synoptic weather stations recording the weather"


4) Page 2 Top line - there is a spelling mistake, double "p" in Raspberry. 


5) Page 3 bottom para. There is a problem with a sub-heading. this should read:-

"Collecting Raw Weather Data the Open Source Way
Readings from instruments"


6) Page 3 middle of para 2. should read

 "However, the temperature and pressure monitors should be mounted lower, at around two metres above ground level"


7) Page 3  I understand that space is limited but  the second appendix paragraph  on the right hand side  of the page is confusing. Would it be possible to make them read:-

For example, in the load_weather_data script we set up some text strings, identify  “~/squall/data/raw” by the name PREFIX and let the program know that should treat PREFIX as a string by referring to it as $PREFIX

PREFIX="~/squall/data/raw/"
SUFFIX=".txt"

We have the beginning and the ending of our filename but need to call the date function to 
get today's date. We need to store ore files in folders using the year, month and date eg
 $FILE might be 2013/2013-12/2013-12-30

We can achieve this using the bash command:-
 
FILE=$(date +"%Y/%Y-%m/%Y-%m-%d")

Finally we can join PREFIX, FILE and SUFFFIX together
to get our filename – which we can refer to later as $FILENAME

FILENAME=$PREFIX$FILE$SUFFIX

$FILENAME could be "~/squall/data/raw/2013/2013-12/2013-12-30.txt".



8) page 4  second paragraph. This is a little difficult to read. Is it possible to indent  everything after "......loading new data onto the database:-" Perhaps using a contrasting typeface and smaller font  size eg:-

For example when  loading new data onto the database: 
      mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -praspberry --local-infile --verbose squall <
     ~/squall/scripts/sql/load_weather_data.sql myysql
 
This command calls the MySQL database manager.
   - hlocalhost confirms we are working on our local machine (security is a big issue if we want to
    work remotely).
   -uroot this is the database root user, not the root for the whole Raspberry Pi! On a full                   production machine we would not run as root.
    -praspberry the password for the database root
    --local-infile warns MySQL to expect some data within a file (you must specify this but it is            NOT the name of the datafile itself.
    --verbose if something goes wrong give us some  clues.
    squall the name of the database we want to use.
    filename.sql a file containing valid SQL commands.

This command invokes MySQL but the SQL isctually within the file, load_weather_data.sql. The SQL is:-

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '~/squall/data/indata.dat'
INTO TABLE rawdata
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';




9) Page 4 second para on right hand side. Again I think that layout is confusing.
 I think it would be clearer with more spaces and indentation eg

download pywws-13.10-r1085.tar.gz from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywws/13.10-r1085

Move the pywws archive to the working squall directory
pi@raspi256 ~ $ mv pywws-13.10-r1085.tar.gz ~/squall
pi@raspi256 ~ $ cd ~/squall
pi@raspi256 ~/squall $ tar zxvf pywws-13.10-r1085.tar.gz


Remove the archive file if you are short of space.
pi@raspi256 ~/squall $ rm pywws-13.10-r1085.tar.gz
